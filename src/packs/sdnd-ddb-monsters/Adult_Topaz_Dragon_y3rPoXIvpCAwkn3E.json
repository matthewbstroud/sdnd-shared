        "value": "<p>Decay and despair are bound up in the nature of topaz dragons, thanks to the necrotic energy of the Negative Plane that suffuses them. Their psionic power manifests the fundamental entropic principle that mortal beings and their creations are ultimately doomed to death and decomposition, and the dragons’ demeanor is typically morbid and curmudgeonly as a result.</p>\n<h3>Gleaming Gold</h3>\n<p>Upon hatching, topaz dragon wyrmling;topaz dragon wyrmlings’ scales are dull yellow-orange and have a cloudy or filmy look. As they age, their scales harden and clarify, becoming translucent and faceted, and ranging from bright yellow to rich amber in color. Their bodies are wider at the haunches, tapering in a wedge shape toward the head, and their wings are shaped to propel them through both air and water. A topaz dragon’s psionic power manifests visibly in the gem-like spines that run in a ridge from the crown of the head to the tip of the tail. These spines hover above a living topaz dragon’s back, dancing and shifting with the dragon’s mood.</p>\n<h3>Embodiment of Decay</h3>\n<p>While generally not malicious, topaz dragons embody decay. They view destruction as a natural means of clearing the way for new creation and growth, much as a forest fire clears dead wood, replenishes the soil, and allows the forest to regrow even healthier than before. To this end, topaz dragons use their power to reduce crumbling structures and diseased plants to dust, clearing the way for new growth and construction.</p>\n<p>Despite being competent swimmers and making their lairs on seacoasts and in brackish marshes, topaz dragons hate the water. Unfortunately, their favorite food is giant squid, so these dragons have ample opportunity to complain bitterly about being wet after diving deep into the ocean in search of prey.</p>\n<p>Topaz dragons often come into conflict with bronze dragons when their coastal territories overlap, and they can nurture an inexplicably intense hatred of these metallic dragons. They can also draw the ire of druids and other nature protectors who don’t understand the dragons’ proclivity for destroying large swaths of countryside. Beyond that, topaz dragons dislike company and grow irritated when disturbed. But anyone who can endure their abrasive demeanor, caustic observations, and morbid interests can form a lasting bond with a powerful ally.</p>\n<h3>Entropic Hoards</h3>\n<p>Topaz dragons prize information on destruction and creation, whether abstract or dedicated to practical applications. They are fascinated by magic that creates objects from nothing, animates Undead, destroys matter, or manipulates negative energy. And they are particularly intrigued by Undead, sometimes keeping them in their hoards as curios.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaTopazDragon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Creating a Topaz Dragon</h3>\n<p>Use the Topaz Dragon Personality Traits and Topaz Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive topaz dragon characters.</p>\n<h4 id=\"TopazDragonPersonalityTraits\" class=\"compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude\">Topaz Dragon Personality Traits</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th>Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I seek no company other than my own, for no one else can compete with me.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>If my offspring can’t care for themselves, I’m not sure they’re worthy of my attention.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>The sea is beautiful and I love gazing upon it, but I abhor being wet.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Why should I risk damaging my splendid physique when I can fight with the power of my mind?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>I am predictable only in my unpredictability.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>It takes true artistry to maintain a warm, desert-like dwelling under the water.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>I soothe myself to sleep by imagining the perfect insults for bronze dragons; while I wait to meet one, I hone them on other creatures.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>I secretly enjoy conversing with lesser beings, although I usually do so only to find their weaknesses.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"TopazDragonIdeals\" class=\"compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude\">Topaz Dragon Ideals</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th>Ideal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><strong>Solitude.</strong> My own company obviates the need for others in my life, whether they are dragons or lesser creatures.

The lair is set in a cavern complex near the top of the cliffs, 50 feet above the sandy beaches, outcroppings, and islands below. It has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Outcropping.</strong> A flat outcropping with sheer limestone sides, mostly bare, offers a comfortable spot where the dragon can bask in the sunlight and watch the waves below.</p>\n<p><strong>Entry Tunnel.</strong> A long tunnel leads from the outcropping to the heart of the lair.</p>\n<p><strong>Decorated Caverns.</strong> The walls of the lair are mostly still in their natural state but are hung with the dragon’s collection of nautical paintings, mirrors, and sun-colored tapestries. Numerous gold-and-glass hanging lanterns are suspended from the ceiling, giving the place a warm, cozy glow. (The lanterns might be magical or maintained by minions.) The floors are covered with plush sand-colored carpets.</p>\n<p><strong>Hoard Chamber.</strong> A small chamber in the upper left corner of the map contains the dragon’s hoard. The area is decorated in a similar fashion to the main chamber, and its collected jewels and gold are painstakingly organized and tucked into chests stacked on gold-chased shelves.</p>\n<p><strong>Clifftop Path.</strong> A second exit from the cave allows the dragon quick access to the lair and leads to a narrow path bordered on the right by a sheer 50-foot drop and on the left by a cliff wall just as steep and devoid of hand- or footholds. The dragon has festooned this path with tripwire alarms and minor booby traps.</p>\n<p><strong>Islands.</strong> Three small islands jut from the water below the outcropping. The largest features cliffs that rise steeply to a plateau 40 feet above sea level. The dragon sometimes basks here as well and takes many meals atop the plateau.</p>",

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>\n<p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p>\n<p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>\n<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} (&amp;Reference[ath]{Athletics}) check against your spell save DC.</p>\n<p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 &amp;Reference[bludgeoning]{bludgeoning} damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} (&amp;Reference[ath]{Athletics}) check to do so.</p>\n<p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 &amp;Reference[bludgeoning]{bludgeoning} damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>\n</div>",
