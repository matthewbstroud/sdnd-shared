        "value": "<p>Amethyst dragons, the mightiest of the gem dragons, study and psionically manipulate the fundamental principles of the multiverse, from the force of gravity to the emanations of the Outer Planes. Their innate psionics give them a measure of control over how physical laws affect them. They defy gravity with flight that doesn’t rely solely upon their great wings, and gravitational force empowers both their devastating breath weapon and the exploding amethyst crystals they spit at their foes.</p>\n<h3>Royal Purple</h3>\n<p>When first hatched, an amethyst dragon has scales of dull, opaque purple. As the dragon grows, their scales, horns, and wing membranes become more vibrant and translucent. When the dragon is fully mature, their scales resemble rich purple amethyst crystals, refracting light to take on an inner glow. Their pupils fade with age, making the eyes of an ancient dragon resemble glowing white or pale lavender orbs. Crystalline horns reminiscent of amethyst chunks hover behind their heads, held there by telekinetic force and shifting with their moods.</p>\n<h3>Cosmological Study</h3>\n<p>Many amethyst dragons are fascinated by the existence of other worlds in the Material Plane, and especially the way individual dragons manifest unique echoes across those worlds. They also prize understanding of the cosmic forces that emanate from the Outer Planes, studying the opposing tides of good and evil, chaos and order, so they can offer counsel to those with the wisdom to accept it.</p>\n<p>Amethyst dragons pay particular attention to intrusions of the Far Realm into the Material Plane. They loathe the corruption that accompanies such intrusions into the world, making them fierce opponents of the Far Realm and any creatures warped by its touch. Strangely, though, they are intrigued by and fond of flumph;flumphs. These Aberrations, which oppose the depredations of mind flayer;mind flayers and other wicked Aberrations, remind amethyst dragons that allies can be found in the strangest places.</p>\n<h3>Hoarded Arcana</h3>\n<p>In addition to material wealth, amethyst dragons delight in collecting knowledge and magic dealing with the nature of the planes of existence, cosmic forces, and distant worlds. They prize treasures drawn from different worlds of the Material Plane, especially magic items and artworks that highlight the unique nature of different worlds. Magic items that allow teleportation or travel between planes, spellbooks filled with similar magic, and treatises examining the nature of the multiverse form the centerpiece of an amethyst dragon’s hoard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatinganAmethystDragon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Creating an Amethyst Dragon</h3>\n<p>Use the Amethyst Dragon Personality Traits and Amethyst Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive amethyst dragon characters.</p>\n<h4 id=\"AmethystDragonPersonalityTraits\" class=\"compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude\">Amethyst Dragon Personality Traits</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th>Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I am never so content as when contemplating the beauty and wonders of the multiverse.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I am a sworn protector against the depredations of the Far Realm, and I will root out its corruption wherever it may arise.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>What use is vast knowledge or insight if it is not shared with those who can appreciate it?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Although some are fascinated by words, I think numbers are the true foundations of creation.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>To experience a thing is to truly understand it.

A lair behind a cascading waterfall is ideal, and often part of that lair is submerged, allowing the dragon to rest in the water and cultivate the fish that are their preferred food.</p>\n<p>Amethyst dragon lairs frequently exhibit or develop large and beautiful clusters of amethyst crystals, including massive cathedral geodes split open to show their contents and clusters of crystal points more than a foot in diameter that extend six to ten feet from the interior stone surfaces of the lair. These crystals resonate with the dragon’s presence, and glow with a soft inner light. The older the dragon, the deeper the purple color of the crystals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"AmethystDragonLairFeatures\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Amethyst Dragon Lair Features</h4>\n<p>The amethyst dragon lair shown in <a title=\"map 5.1\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon#Map51amethystdragonlair\">map 5.1</a> is set beneath a mountain ridge between two deep tarns, with streams flowing down toward the lowlands. The lair has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Entrances.</strong> Two cave entrances provide access to the lair, one in the rock face just above one tarn and one below the surface of the other tarn. The dragon uses the underwater passage as a secret entrance and emergency exit.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Caves.</strong> The lair is a complex of caves and tunnels; the stone surfaces are smooth and water-worn, and the air is cool and slightly damp.</p>\n<p><strong>Glowing Crystals.</strong> Large clusters of glowing amethyst crystals grow out from the walls and ceiling, casting dim light in a 30-foot radius.</p>\n<p><strong>Chimneys.</strong> Two chimneys connect the main caves to the three chambers above. Each chimney appears to continue up through the ceiling of the upper level and down through the floor of the lower level, but the dragon’s magic warps space within the lair. Moving up past the upper level brings a creature to the lower level again, while moving down from the lower level brings a creature to the upper level. A creature or object dropped down one of the chimneys continues falling endlessly unless it or some outside force has the means to slow or stop it. This property of the lair vanishes after 1d10 days if the dragon dies.</p>\n<p><strong>Upper Caves.</strong> The dragon most often sleeps in the largest upper chamber of the lair. The dragon’s hoard is divided between that area and the chamber at the opposite end of the upper level. The magic of the lair sometimes makes it appear as though the dragon were sleeping amid both caches, creating the impression that two dragons dwell here.</p>",

          "value": "<div class=\"ddb\">\n<p>Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a &amp;Reference[cube]{cube} up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>\n<p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.</p>\n<p>If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>\n<p>The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\n<p><strong>Part Water.</strong> You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.</p>\n<p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} (&amp;Reference[ath]{Athletics}) check against your spell save DC.</p>\n<p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 &amp;Reference[bludgeoning]{bludgeoning} damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} (&amp;Reference[ath]{Athletics}) check to do so.</p>\n<p>The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 &amp;Reference[bludgeoning]{bludgeoning} damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>\n</div>",
