        "value": "<p>The thunderous clash of conflict is part of the very nature of sapphire dragons. Militant and territorial, they defend their lairs fiercely, ambushing intruders and plotting assaults against their rivals. The sonic pulse of their breath weapon sows weakness, leaving the victims unable to fight back.</p>\n<h3>Luminous Blue</h3>\n<p>Sapphire dragons’ scales and wing membranes show varied shades of blue, ranging from the light tones of a spring sky to the rich, crystalline azure of sapphire gems and compressed glacial ice. In the light, the scales glitter and shine like luminous starbursts. The dragons’ psionic nature is evident in the horn and bone structures of their bodies. Their tail barbs and horn tips are all separate pieces, but they float in place, held aloft by psychic energy while the dragons live. These levitating horns and spines shift slightly with the dragons’ moods, bobbing in amusement or flaring with anger.</p>\n<h3>Art of War</h3>\n<p>The warlike sapphire dragons devise strategies and ambushes based on their ability to maneuver underground. A sapphire dragon often refrains from striking immediately, preferring to assess intruders first in order to devise the most advantageous approach to dealing with them.</p>\n<p>Sapphire dragons watch for signs of Aberrations and other creatures corrupted by the Far Realm. They frequently ally with emerald dragons, drawing on their kin’s knowledge of occult phenomena to track the influence of the Far Realm. Armed with that knowledge, sapphire dragons stamp out alien influence before it spreads.</p>\n<p>People who dwell or delve deep beneath the earth can easily find themselves at odds with a sapphire dragon if they cross into the dragon’s territory. But sapphire dragons sometimes forge peaceful relationships with rock gnomes or deep gnomes, relying on these folk to help protect the territory surrounding their lairs.</p>\n<h3>Martial Hoards</h3>\n<p>Sapphire dragons’ favorite prizes are weapons and armor, records of military history and tactics, and magic items that protect against psychic damage or mental intrusion. The centerpiece of a sapphire dragon’s hoard is usually a cataloged, orderly collection of war gear, which can contain ancient relics of immense power.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaSapphireDragon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Creating a Sapphire Dragon</h3>\n<p>Use the Sapphire Dragon Personality Traits and Sapphire Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive sapphire dragon characters.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SapphireDragonPersonalityTraits\" class=\"compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude\">Sapphire Dragon Personality Traits</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th>Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I often fixate on specific historical battles or wars and won’t rest until my hoard contains that conflict’s most significant artifacts.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I am constantly aware of a call from beyond this world.

As they grow older, they continually renovate their lairs, using their tunneling abilities and command over stone.</p>\n<p>Sapphire dragons eventually create dizzying honeycombs of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow them to traverse the entire lair without ever being seen by intruders. The best-defended sapphire dragon lairs have no easily accessible entrances or exits at all, and trespassers who do find their way inside must then contend with a maze of corridors, dead ends, and steep inclines.</p>\n<h4 id=\"SapphireDragonLairFeatures\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Sapphire Dragon Lair Features</h4>\n<p>The sapphire dragon lair shown in <a title=\"map 5.12\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/draconomicon-continued#Map512sapphiredragonlair\">map 5.12</a> is a series of natural tunnels and chambers the dragon has adapted to serve as a lair. The lair has few natural entrances, so whole sections are inaccessible without excavation or magic, as the dragon can simply open doorways in walls whenever necessary.</p>\n<p>The lair has the following features:</p>\n<p><strong>Disguised Entrances.</strong> An otherwise unremarkable cave (shown at the top of the map) provides the main access to the lair by way of two sections of relatively thin crystal walls. The dragon can use a lair action to open or close passages through these walls throughout the lair.</p>\n<p><strong>Cobweb-Choked Tunnels.</strong> Adventurers who manage to access the other side of the cave’s crystal walls discover a network of dark, cobweb-choked tunnels extending deep into the earth, set with natural steps and shelves throughout. The dragon spends little time in this part of the lair, visiting only when the spiders there need tending—or when the dragon needs a snack.</p>\n<p><strong>Underground River.</strong> A river flows along the right and bottom edges of the map, providing the dragon with fresh water and an alternative entrance. Originating on the surface, the river descends through narrow tunnels that eventually lead to the Underdark.</p>\n<p><strong>Hoard Caverns.</strong> The bulk of the lair, filling most of the lower half of the map, comprises chambers the dragon uses to host guests and visitors. These caverns hold the bulk of the dragon’s hoard, particularly art objects that are impressive but not irreplaceable.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleeping Chamber.</strong> At the heart of the lair, protected behind more thin crystal walls, the largest cavern serves as the dragon’s sleeping chamber. A raised section studded with sapphire crystals offers a vantage from which the dragon can keep an eye on the chamber’s access points. The dragon’s most valuable treasures are stored here and in adjoining caves, and the walls of this central chamber are covered in art depicting various battles—many of which the dragon took part in.</p>",

If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell.

A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.</p>\n<p>On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.</p>\n<p><strong>Object.</strong> You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot &amp;Reference[cube]{cube}, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.</p>\n<p>The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and consults the table.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Familiarity</th>\n<th>Mishap</th>\n<th>Similar Area</th>\n<th>Off Target</th>\n<th>On Target</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Permanent circle</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>01-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Associated object</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>01-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very familiar</td>\n<td>01-05</td>\n<td>06-13</td>\n<td>14-24</td>\n<td>25-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seen casually</td>\n<td>01-33</td>\n<td>34-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viewed once</td>\n<td>01-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-73</td>\n<td>74-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>01-43</td>\n<td>44-53</td>\n<td>54-73</td>\n<td>74-100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>False destination</td>\n<td>01-50</td>\n<td>51-100</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Familiarity.</strong> \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.</p>\n<p>\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.</p>\n<p>\"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an &amp;Reference[ill]{illusion}, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.</p>\n<p><strong>On Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 &amp;Reference[force]{force} damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>\n</div>",
