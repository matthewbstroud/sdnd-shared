        "value": "<p class=\"p1\">Ancient legends suggest that when the gods came to the First World and tried to populate it with their Humanoid followers, a clever dragon fled to the Feywild to hide a clutch of eggs. The magic of that faerie realm suffused the eggs, which hatched into the first moonstone dragons. Their descendants are now found throughout the Feywild.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moonstone dragons are graceful and elegant creatures with opalescent scales and ruffs of emerald-green fur running down their chins, chests, backs, and tails. One horn arcs from the back of a moonstone dragon’s skull and another at the tip of the nose; the two horns together form a shape that’s reminiscent of a slender crescent moon. Moonstone dragons are playful and impetuous forces of mischief in their early years, but the best of them mature into wise teachers and storytellers who anchor Feywild communities. The worst of them are pompous and ill behaved, but even those remain gentle by nature and curious about all things—especially travelers from faraway places.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Moonstone dragons can project themselves into the realm of dreams to communicate with the creatures that sleep near their lairs. In this way, they inspire artists and poets, encourage great thinkers, and spur adventurers to heroic deeds. They sometimes give guidance to those in need or request help from adventurers to encourage them to greatness.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a rule, moonstone dragons are not particularly interested in gold or copper, but they love silver, platinum, and mithral. They also cherish treasures whose value can’t be easily quantified—a song sung from the heart, a lock of a loved one’s hair, or a painting of a favorite place. A story of happy times fondly remembered is more precious to a moonstone dragon than a sack of gold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CreatingaMoonstoneDragon\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Creating a Moonstone Dragon</h3>\n<p>Use the Moonstone Dragon Personality Traits and Moonstone Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive moonstone dragon characters.</p>\n<h4 id=\"MoonstoneDragonPersonalityTraits\" class=\"compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude\">Moonstone Dragon Personality Traits</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th>Trait</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>I often lose track of whether I’m in the Feywild or on the Material Plane.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I have been known to throw caution to the wind when in pursuit of new items for my hoard.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>No matter how old I get, I always delight in harmless pranks and tricks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>I’ve always been mature for my age, and I can’t wait for the day I can retire to my lair to be taken care of by doting fey.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>I look down upon any being who resorts to violence to solve a problem.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Conversing with others is often difficult because I’m so easily distr… oh my goodness, is that circlet made of <em>silver</em>?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>I find the waking world tedious and mundane and would much rather spend my time asleep, in the realm of dreams.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>I find the whimsy of fey, and whimsy in general, to be exasperating and exhausting.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"MoonstoneDragonIdeals\" class=\"compendium-hr quick-menu-exclude\">Moonstone Dragon Ideals</h4>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th>Ideal</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td><strong>Curiosity.</strong> I might never be able to experience everything in the multiverse—but it doesn’t hurt to try.
