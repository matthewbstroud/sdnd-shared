      "value": "<div class=\"ddb\">\n<p>A 10-foot-radius &amp;Reference[invisible]{invisible} &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} moves with you, centered on you.</p>\n<p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as <strong>magic missile</strong> and <strong>charm person</strong>, that target a creature or an object in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} have no effect on that target.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <strong>fireball</strong>, can't extend into the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}. If the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <strong>wall of &amp;Reference[fire]{fire}</strong> are suppressed within the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}. For example, a <strong>longsword, +1</strong> in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>\n<p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} or wielded by an attacker in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} (for example, if you &amp;Reference[fire]{fire} a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}, whether the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere} is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}.</p>\n<p><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}.</p>\n<p><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong> Spells and magical effects such as <strong>dispel magic</strong> have no effect on the &amp;Reference[sphere]{sphere}. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.</p>\n</div>",
