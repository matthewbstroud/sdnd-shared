Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained}, though it can use an action to end the &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained} condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a &amp;Reference[dex]{Dexterity} saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 &amp;Reference[bludgeoning]{bludgeoning} damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Transmute Mud to Rock. </span></strong>Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell’s duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a &amp;Reference[dex]{Dexterity} saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained} by the rock. A &amp;Reference[restrained]{restrained} creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to &amp;Reference[poison]{poison} and &amp;Reference[psychic]{psychic} damage.</p>\n</div>",
