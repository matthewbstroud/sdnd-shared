      "value": "<div class=\"ddb\">\n<p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Six Buttons.</strong> You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to &amp;Reference[str]{Strength} checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p>\n<p><strong>Drain Life.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can &amp;Reference[force]{force} the target to make a [[/save con 17 format=long]]. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 &amp;Reference[necrotic]{necrotic} damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that &amp;Reference[necrotic]{necrotic} damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Paralyze.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can &amp;Reference[force]{force} the target to make a [[/save str 17 format=long]]. On a failure, the target is &amp;Reference[paralyzed]{paralyzed} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrify.</strong> While holding the rod, you can use an action to &amp;Reference[force]{force} each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a [[/save wis 17 format=long]]. On a failure, a target is &amp;Reference[frightened]{frightened} of you for 1 minute. A &amp;Reference[frightened]{frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n</div>",
